# Track User Location

## 🌍 Overview
This is a simple web application that tracks a user's location using the browser's Geolocation API. It fetches the latitude and longitude of the user and displays the location on a map.

## 🚀 Features
- Get real-time user location (latitude & longitude)
- Display location on an interactive map (using Google Maps or OpenStreetMap)
- Works on both mobile and desktop browsers
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into other projects

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Geolocation API
- Google Maps / OpenStreetMap (optional)

## 📌 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/prabhatrana666/track-user-location.git
   cd track-user-location
   ```

2. **Open the project in a code editor**

3. **Run the project locally**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser

## 📍 How It Works
1. The webpage requests permission to access the user's location.
2. If the user grants permission, the browser fetches latitude and longitude.
3. The location is displayed on a map in real-time.
4. If permission is denied, an error message is shown.

## ⚠️ Permissions & Privacy
- The app only accesses the location when the user explicitly grants permission.
- No data is stored or shared with third parties.

## 🏗️ Future Enhancements
- Show address using Reverse Geocoding
- Add IP-based location tracking as an alternative
- Improve UI/UX with better design and animations
